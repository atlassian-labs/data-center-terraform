# Troubleshooting tips

This guide contains general tips on how to investigate an application deployment that doesn't work correctly.

## AWS Access
The Terraform cannot deploy resources into AWS Cloud if you have no access to an AWS account with admin permission. 
If your security token is expired you will see the following message on console. Renew your token and retry. 

```
Terraform uses 'config.tfvars' to install the infrastructure.
Verifying the config file.
Cleaning all the generated terraform state variable and backend file.
ngh-bamboo' infrastructure deployment is started using config.tfvars.
Terraform state backend/variable files are missing.

An error occurred (ExpiredToken) when calling the GetCallerIdentity operation: The security token included in the request is expired
```

## Cleanup Terraform state
Terraform stores the lock and current state in the terraform backend file in `terraform-backend.tf`. 
This file will be generated by the install process based on the content of `config.auto.tfvars`.
If the user changes some key configuration items such as `region` or `environment_name` then you should 
cleanup all temporary files generated by terraform and install modules again. 

To cleanup the local terraform files, run the following command:
```
./pkg/scripts/cleanup.sh
```

## How to unlock terraform
If user interrupts the execution of install or uninstall actions, Terraform locked the resources but never get a chance to
 unlock them. In this case in next attempt you may see the following error:
 

```
Acquiring state lock. This may take a few moments...
╷

│ Terraform acquires a state lock to protect the state from being written

│ flag, but this is not recommended.

```

To fix this you need to unlock state first by running the following command 
(replace ID with the value from the error message):

```shell 
terraform force-unlock <ID>
```

!!! hint "After running the unlock command still you see the error?"
    There are two terraform locks, one for infrastructure and another for terraform state. If running the following 
    command from repo folder does not unlock the resources, then change the current path to `./pkg/tfstate` and retry
     the same command.
