### Bitbucket scaling up issue with NFS

There is an intermittent issue when scaling the Bitbucket cluster up results in new pods not being able to acquire a lock on the shared home. 

Log file: 
    
```
bitbucket have write permission on that directory? Is file locking enabled for the filesystem?

Please ensure that the user running Bitbucket has permission to write to this directory and that file locking is enabled for your network file system.

If this is already the case, please check the logs for more information.

```

This issue is intermittent and is occasionally exhibited when scaling the pod count from `1` to `2`. 
If you pre-seed the Bitbucket instance and set `bitbucket_replica_count` to `2` from the beginning, no issue will occur.

When encountered, the issue can be resolved by killing the Bitbucket and NFS pods and waiting for them to become available again.

```
kubectl delete pod bitbucket-0 -n atlassian
kubectl delete pod bitbucket-nfs-server-0 -n atlassian
```

## Infrastructure limitations

### Cloud provider

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the only supported cloud platform.

### Database

PostgreSQL is the defined database engine for the products and cannot be modified in the configuration. However, users can change the database [instance type](../userguide/configuration/CONFIGURATION.md#database-instance-class) and [storage size](../userguide/configuration/CONFIGURATION.md#database-allocated-storage).

### Domain
Stick to either domain or no domain for the whole deployment, i.e. configure `domain = "<example.com>"` value or leave it commented. 
Switching between domain and no domain is not supported.

## Deployment limitations
Destroying product by removing product from products list and then running another install is not supported
as it will result in unexpected behaviour on the following re-installation.
