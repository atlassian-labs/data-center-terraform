Atlassian DC APP program provides App vendors in our ecosystem with ready-to-use environment setup tools. 
This project provides a tool to provision infrastructure for Atlassian DC helm chart products.
At this stage the scope is providing the infrastructure for Bamboo.  


## Usage

In order to use this project you need to have the following application installed on your local machine and an admin access to an AWS account:

* AWS CLI
* helm
* Terraform

## Installation
Before install the infrastructure for Atlassian products please make sure you read the [perquisite](userguide/PREREQUISITES.md) section and 
completed the [configuration](userguide/CONFIGURATION.md) step. 

After you reviewed the above steps you can [install](userguide/INSTALLATION.md) the Atlassian data center infrastructure and selected products. 

## Uninstall the products and cleanup infrastructure

To uninstall the product and clean up the infrastructure run the following command:
```shell 
./pkg/scripts/uninstall -p <product>
```

This will remove the products and all Atlassian data center infrastructure and terraform state will remain in S3 bucket and dynamodb generated by install process. 
If you want to keep the terraform state then use the switch `-s`:
```shell 
./pkg/scripts/uninstall -p <product> -s
```
